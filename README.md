# Banner Gen

This is a clone of [Banner Generator](https://github.com/christopherkade/banner-generator).
The idea, from my perspective, is tackle it from a Data Orientented approach.
Meaning, effectively moving data from input to the generator, then from the
generator to output.

## Build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CaffeineOrDeath/banner-gen
cd banner-gen
go run ./cmd/server/.
```
